### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a french developer working mainly on Psalm plugins to help migrate legacy PHP codebase.

List of plugins that can fix code:
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-strict-types: Adds strict_types declaration when the file is provably safe 
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-not-empty: Automatically change empty() into a more explicit expression 
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-strict-equality: Automatically change == into === when safe 
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-use-constants: Fix the code to use existing constants instead of literals when available

List of plugins that can detect bad practice
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-insane-comparison: Detects possible insane comparison ("string" == 0) to help migrate to PHP8 
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-strict-visibility: A Psalm plugin to detect calling private or protected method via proxy 
- https://github.com/orklah/psalm-strict-numeric-cast: Restrict the use of (int) and (float) to numeric-string only
